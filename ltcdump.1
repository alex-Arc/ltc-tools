Channel count starts at '1', which is also the default channel to analyze.
.PP
The fps option is only needed to properly track the first LTC frame,
and timecode discontinuity notification.
The LTC\-decoder detects and tracks the speed but it takes a few samples
to establish initial synchronization. Setting fps to the expected fps
speeds up the initial sync process. The default is 25/1.
